# PREDICTION MODEL
Machine learning models implemented to predict Packs and Value attributes from a dataset. This solution it is propposed to solve a assignment proposed by Randstad company using lineal regression and random forest.

## DATASET TREATMENT

To solve the problem raised, it is necessary 2 models, one for each objective attribute.
Two types of models are tested: Linear Regression model from sklearn library of python is a good option in case of data with linear relations between characteristics and Random Forest for not lineal case.
Dataset is separated on data to train, test and predict. Besides, character “.” is understood as thousands.
Five values of NaN have been found apart from those that are going to be predicted.
